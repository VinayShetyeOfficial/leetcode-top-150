    Problem:
    Given n intervals with startTime, endTime, and cost, find the minimum cost
    to pick two intervals such that their total duration equals timeAvl.

    Approach:
    - Calculate length of each interval: length = endTime[i] - startTime[i] + 1
    - Check all pairs of intervals to see if their total length equals timeAvl.
    - Keep track of minimum sum of their costs.
